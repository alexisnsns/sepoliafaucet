A homemade faucet for Sepolia testnet ETH.

The faucet is currently disabled temporarily â€” need to add rate-limiting to prevent abuse.

sepoliafaucet.vercel.app

TODO:

- 2/check on etherscan if user received in the past 24h from the faucet to avoid spamming (and add key to vercel)
- 3/add some sepolia ETH to the faucet
- 4/ edit readme to add serverless method, two checks made (mainnet balance and 24h check) etc
