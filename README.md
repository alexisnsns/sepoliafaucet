A homemade faucet for Sepolia testnet ETH.

The faucet is currently disabled temporarily â€” need to add rate-limiting to prevent abuse.

sepoliafaucet.vercel.app

TODO:

- 1/fix proper api route
- 2/check on etherscan if user received in the past 24h from the faucet to avoid spamming
- 3/add some sepolia ETH to the faucet
- 4/ edit readme to add serverless method etc
